# Measurement-wheel-DiY
This project is originally by Mirko Pavleski (https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/mircemk/diy-simple-measuring-wheel-with-rotary-encoder-12073d?f=1)
I needed to measure how much perimeter wire I would need for the lawn mover robot. So I have repeated it and tweaked it to my liking:
Added a measuremets reset pushbutton switch which is by default open and connects D4 to ground. I have also tweaked the code to change measurements from cm to m. And added some interactivity in terms of messages during the process.
This repository is in case someone can benefit from what changes I have made.
